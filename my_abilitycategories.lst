# VISIBLE TAG will take YES, NO or QUALIFY - QUALIFY won't display the Category unless it has one valid selection or the number is 1 or higher in the pool.
# New tag - DISPLAYLOCATION:<user defined> will allow you to group ABILITIES together in the same "tab"
# New tag - DISPLAYNAME:<user defined> serves the same function as OUTPUTNAME is showing what is displayed
# Using TYPE will populate the category with any ABILITY with a matching type. Example:
# ABILITYCATEGORY:Fighter Feats	CATEGORY:FEAT	TYPE:Fighter
# That will make all the Feats with TYPE:Fighter appear
# The POOL tag allows you to set a variable that will be added to the pool, this must be a valid variable DEFINEd or hardcoded elsewhere

# DONE
