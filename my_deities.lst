#The first field is the Deity Name, this is a required field and does not have a tag.
#
#The DOMAINS tag is a list of domains that the deity grants to it's divine spell casting followings. The domain name MUST
#match the domain names listed in the domain list file.
#To limit alignments allowed for classes (such as cleric) to gain domains, use PREALIGN on the DOMAINS tag.
#
#The DESC tag is used for a quick description of the deity.
#
#The SYMBOL tag is used on the output sheet to display what the holy symbol is for this deity.
